# AD_Acceptance
Acceptance measurements in AD

The codes aim at evaluating the acceptance with the 0-to-0 calculation.
In particular, AD injection and extraction energies are considered.
Tails build up and core movement in the e-cooler are also observed in the _100MeV/c code.

Finally, acceptance measurements at injection energy on the H plane show that different values are obtained if the Int or the Ext plane is considered.
